                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>36% of college students do not get enough to eat. 63% of college students said that sometimes they skipped meals.</p>
                <p>Lack of time is among the most commonly reported barriers to meal planning.  35% of college students found that they did not have enough food to eat because they couldn’t get to a grocery shop.</p>
                <p>The lack of cooking skills and diversity of food choice for meal-prep are also stopping college student preparing their meals.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2><br>  
                <p>People enjoy not only the physical exercise but also the social contact between people from. However, gathering busy college students for a good cooking party and organize recipes and shopping list is difficult even with existing social media services.</p>

                <h2>Iterate for real needs</h2>
                <p>Cook Pal is a mobile app design of a semester-long solo project. I conducted the end-to-end research and design process. My design evolved along several rounds of iteration at different stages.</p>
